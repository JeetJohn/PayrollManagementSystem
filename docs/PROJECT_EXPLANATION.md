# Payroll Management System - Complete Project Explanation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **Java-based Payroll Management System** with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows companies to manage employee data and calculate payroll. Think of it as a simplified version of what HR departments use to track employees and process their salaries.

## 🧩 Core Components Explained

### 1. **Model Package** (`src/model/`)
**What it does:** Defines the "blueprint" of our data structures.

#### Employee.java
```java
// This is like a digital employee card
public class Employee {
    private int employeeId;        // Unique ID (auto-generated)
    private String name;           // Employee's name
    private String position;       // Job role (Manager, Clerk, Technical)
    private double baseSalary;     // Monthly salary
    private double hoursWorked;    // Hours worked this period
    private double overtimeHours;  // Extra hours worked
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters (data hiding)
- **Constructor**: Special method to create new Employee objects
- **toString()**: Custom method to display employee info nicely

#### PayrollRecord.java
```java
// This is like a pay stub/receipt
public class PayrollRecord {
    private int employeeId;
    private String employeeName;
    private double grossPay;       // Total pay before deductions
    private double tax;            // Tax amount deducted
    private double netPay;         // Final take-home pay
    private LocalDate payDate;     // When this was processed
}
```

### 2. **Utils Package** (`src/utils/`)
**What it does:** Contains helper functions for calculations.

#### PayrollCalculator.java
```java
public class PayrollCalculator {
    // Business rules as constants
    private static final double OVERTIME_RATE = 1.5;    // 1.5x pay for overtime
    private static final double STANDARD_HOURS = 40.0;   // Standard work week
    private static final double TAX_RATE = 0.15;         // 15% tax rate
    
    // Static methods - can be called without creating objects
    public static double calculateGrossPay(Employee employee) {
        // Logic: Regular hours + (Overtime hours × 1.5)
    }
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Static methods**: Utility functions that don't need object instances
- **Constants**: Fixed values that don't change (final keyword)
- **Business logic**: Real-world rules translated into code

### 3. **Data Package** (`src/data/`)
**What it does:** Manages all data storage and retrieval.

#### SimpleDataManager.java
```java
public class SimpleDataManager {
    // In-memory storage (data lost when program closes)
    private Map<Integer, Employee> employees;           // Key-Value storage
    private List<PayrollRecord> payrollRecords;         // Ordered list
    private AtomicInteger nextEmployeeId;               // Thread-safe counter
    
    public int addEmployee(String name, String role, double salary) {
        int id = nextEmployeeId.getAndIncrement();      // Auto-generate ID
        Employee emp = new Employee(id, name, role, salary);
        employees.put(id, emp);                         // Store in map
        return id;
    }
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **HashMap**: Fast key-value storage (O(1) lookup by employee ID)
- **ArrayList**: Dynamic array for storing payroll records
- **AtomicInteger**: Thread-safe counter for generating unique IDs
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete data

### 4. **GUI Package** (`src/gui/`)
**What it does:** Creates the visual interface users interact with.

#### PayrollGUI.java
```java
public class PayrollGUI extends JFrame {
    // Swing components for user interface
    private JTabbedPane tabbedPane;           // Tabbed interface
    private JTable employeeTable;             // Data table
    private JTextField nameField;             // Text input
    private JComboBox<String> roleComboBox;   // Dropdown selection
    
    // Event handling
    private class AddEmployeeListener implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            // What happens when "Add Employee" button is clicked
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Swing Framework**: Java's GUI toolkit
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Code responds to user actions (clicks, typing)
- **MVC Pattern**: Model (data) + View (GUI) + Controller (event handlers)
- **Layout Managers**: Automatic positioning of GUI components

## 🔄 How Everything Works Together

### 1. **Application Startup**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
        new PayrollGUI().setVisible(true);  // Create and show GUI
    });
}
```

### 2. **Data Flow Example: Adding an Employee**
1. **User Input**: User types name, selects role, enters salary
2. **Event Trigger**: User clicks "Add Employee" button
3. **Event Handler**: `AddEmployeeListener.actionPerformed()` is called
4. **Validation**: Check if inputs are valid
5. **Data Processing**: `dataManager.addEmployee()` creates new Employee
6. **Storage**: Employee stored in HashMap with auto-generated ID
7. **UI Update**: Refresh employee table to show new employee
8. **Feedback**: Show success message to user

### 3. **Payroll Calculation Process**
1. **Input**: Employee selection + hours worked + overtime hours
2. **Update**: Store hours in employee object
3. **Calculate**: 
   - Regular Pay = (hours ≤ 40) × (salary ÷ 40)
   - Overtime Pay = overtime hours × (salary ÷ 40) × 1.5
   - Gross Pay = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay
   - Tax = Gross Pay × 0.15
   - Net Pay = Gross Pay - Tax
4. **Record**: Create PayrollRecord object
5. **Store**: Save record in payroll history
6. **Display**: Update payroll table

## 🎓 Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Used

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
- **Class**: Blueprint (Employee.java defines what an employee looks like)
- **Object**: Instance (Each actual employee is an object created from the class)

### 2. **Encapsulation**
```java
private int employeeId;           // Hidden from outside
public int getEmployeeId() {      // Controlled access
    return employeeId;
}
```

### 3. **Inheritance**
```java
public class PayrollGUI extends JFrame  // PayrollGUI inherits from JFrame
```

### 4. **Polymorphism**
```java
@Override
public String toString() {        // Override inherited method
    return String.format("%s (ID: %d)", name, employeeId);
}
```

### 5. **Abstraction**
- Users don't need to know how payroll is calculated
- They just click "Generate Payroll" and get results

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### 1. **Auto-Generated Employee IDs**
```java
private AtomicInteger nextEmployeeId = new AtomicInteger(1);
int id = nextEmployeeId.getAndIncrement();  // 1, 2, 3, 4...
```

### 2. **Role-Based Employee Types**
- Manager, Clerk, Technical (using JComboBox dropdown)

### 3. **Real-Time Data Updates**
- Add employee → Table refreshes automatically
- Generate payroll → Both tables update

### 4. **Input Validation**
```java
if (name.isEmpty()) {
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Please enter employee name.");
    return;
}
```

### 5. **Professional UI Design**
- Tabbed interface for different functions
- Tables for data display
- Forms for data input
- Message dialogs for feedback

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Compile
```bash
cd scripts
compile.bat
```
This converts Java source code (.java) into bytecode (.class files)

### Step 2: Run
```bash
run.bat
```
This starts the Java Virtual Machine and runs the application

## 📊 Business Logic Explained

### Payroll Calculation Rules:
1. **Standard Work Week**: 40 hours
2. **Overtime Rate**: 1.5× regular rate for hours > 40
3. **Tax Rate**: 15% of gross pay
4. **Hourly Rate**: Monthly salary ÷ 40 hours

### Example Calculation:
- Employee: John Doe, Manager, $4000/month
- Hours worked: 45 (40 regular + 5 overtime)
- Hourly rate: $4000 ÷ 40 = $100/hour
- Regular pay: 40 × $100 = $4000
- Overtime pay: 5 × $100 × 1.5 = $750
- Gross pay: $4000 + $750 = $4750
- Tax: $4750 × 0.15 = $712.50
- Net pay: $4750 - $712.50 = $4037.50
